Welcome to my provisional portfolio! This portfolio was created three years ago when I was a junior in the field of web development. It showcases some of my early projects and serves as a reflection of my progress and skills at that time.

Please note that this portfolio is provisional, meaning it is not an accurate representation of my current abilities and experience. Since its creation, I have gained significant knowledge, acquired new skills, and completed more advanced projects. If you're interested in seeing my updated and more comprehensive portfolio, please reach out to me directly.
